    A flaw in the current random selection is that albums are all given equal
    weight meaning songs on large albums are less likely to be selected and
    singles will be played more often.  I would like to fix this without making
    excessive API requests but am not sure this is possible.
    Another flaw is that duplicate albums are not filtered and singles are not
    discarded but this is probably not worth attempting to fix
